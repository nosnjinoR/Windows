# I have a question!

We have a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/git-for-windows). It is actually a Google Group which can be used as if it were a forum, too.

## But I really have only a quick question!

There is a [chat room](https://gitter.im/git-for-windows/git).

## But I would prefer to email somebody directly!
