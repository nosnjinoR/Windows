There are several ways to participate in the Git for Windows project. First off, have a look at the [governance model](https://gitforwindows.org/governance-model.html) of the project.

# Help users

On [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows) or on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues), help is always welcome.

# Add documentation

A lot of documentation wants to be written, still. A good place is [the Git for Windows wiki](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/blob/HEAD/Documentation/git-for-windows/Home.md). Tutorials, step by step instructions and general background information, etc. Even just keep the links up to date and reporting inconsistencies is helpful.

# Fix bugs or add features in the Git code itself

Download [the SDK](https://gitforwindows.org/#download-sdk) and build Git. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) page/file


Also have a look at [this page](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/blob/HEAD/Documentation/git-for-windows/Building-Git.md) for tips and tricks revolving around building and debugging Git.

Please also sign off your work, as [asked by the Git project](https://git-scm.com/docs/SubmittingPatches#sign-off)

After that, submit a Pull Request.

Sometimes there are good suggestions how to improve the patches in a Pull Request. When that happens, just [rewrite and force-push the branch](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history).
